                Branched Gaming Network is a multi-faceted community designed with content creators and consumers, alike, in mind.
                We strive to connect consumers with the content they desire as well as expose them to new games, content, and like-minded individuals.
                Additionally, it is our mission to enable small, community-oriented streamers to grow and nurture their craft with technical, graphical,
                and management support.  Most of all, we encourage everyone to 'Branch Out' and explore new and exciting facets of life every chance they get.
